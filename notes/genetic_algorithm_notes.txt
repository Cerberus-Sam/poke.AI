What is success in a Pokemon game?
- Exploration
    - Being able to explore as much of the map as possible (how much the ai chooses to explore the map can be trained)
    - Being able to do this as efficiently as possible (this can be trained)
- Collecting normal and key items
- Reaching key parts of a story

So what are the things the AI's actually learning?
- How to do things as fast/efficiently as possible
- If we clearly define meeting certain NPCs in a particular order with very high rewards, the AI can learn how to finish the game in the fastest way possible.
- 

Events procedure for first part:
- Enter May's house
- Touch pokeball
- Go to grass
- Go back to grass

First just make an AI that can map out the level and perform exploration in the most efficient way possible

List of decision inputs:
All are binary - think about whether to change some of the binary ones to just x and y coordinates.
- Is there an unvisited house up?
- Is there an unvisited house below?
- Is there an unvisited house left?
- Is there an unvisited house right?
- Is there a visited house up?
- Is there a visited house below?
- Is there a visited house left?
- Is there a visited house right?
- Is there an uninteracted npc up?
- Is there an uninteracted npc below?
- Is there an uninteracted npc left?
- Is there an uninteracted npc right?
- Did my position change since the last command?
- Have I visited up?
- Have I visited below?
- Have I visited left?
- Have I visited right?

// Hidden layers come hereeeee

List of outputs:
You will be output a probability that tells which action the AI believes is the best.
- Go up
- Go down
- Go left
- Go right
- Interact

Score:
- Based on how close the drawn map is to the ground truth map.
- Based on time taken to reach the end (or if time expired)
- Give score based on rate of NPCs met and houses visited over time.
    - A different score is given for visiting the gym, pokemon center, and pokemart, in descending order.
    - Therefore the longer it takes to explore, the worse score it gets.

Things to randomize and mutate and evolve:
- Hidden layers in neural network
- Number of nodes in each layer
- ??? Weights and biases for each node ???
